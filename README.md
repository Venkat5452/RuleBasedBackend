# Application 1: Rule Engine with AST:
# This application is developed using the MERN stack:
1. Frontend: React.js
2. Backend: Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB
# Steps to Develop the Application
Frontend:
1.	Initialize the React app: npx create-react-app frontend
2.	Install the necessary dependencies: npm install react react-bootstrap bootstrap axios
3.	Start the React development server: npm start
4.	Connect the frontend to the backend using a helper function (e.g., helper.js).
Backend:
1.	Initialize the Node.js project: npm init
2.	Create the server.js file to define the server.
3.	Install the required packages: npm install express mongoose cors
4.	Implement the logic in server.js to create the server and connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
5.	Define the classes and structure to create the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
6.	Create the necessary API endpoints:
o	/create_rule for creating rules
o	/evaluate_rule for evaluating rules with data
o	/combine_rules for combining multiple rules
7.	Run the server using Nodemon: nodemon server.js
# Deployment:
  Backend is deployed on Render.
  Frontend is deployed on Netlify.
